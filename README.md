## Description

- This is a coding quiz. it behaves sort of like a game, the user will begin the quiz going against a timer of 60 seconds while that is happening they will be displayed a question with 4 choices. if the user correctly picks the answer to the question they will be directed to the next page with no time deducted. however, if the user chooses the incorrect answer to the question ten seconds will be deducted from the timer, while still proceeding to the next question in the quiz. the users goal is to reach the end of the quiz before the timer runs out. Highscores will be tracked for the user to view.

## Usage

It all starts with clicking the start button at the main screen.
